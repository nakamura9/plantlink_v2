# Planning

The program provides a calendar for visualizing important time sensitive information.
In particular it's responsible for showing planning information regarding:
- Run Schedules
- Planned maintenance events

The calendar can be viewed in 4 different modes
- Month view
- Week view
- Day view
- Gantt view

The last view is helpful for viewing events that span multiple days.
To navigate between views, use the buttons labelled on the top right of the page. To view previous and next groups of data within the same view, use the arrow buttons on the top right of the page.

In the month and week views, clicking on a date number will bring up the day view for the selected content.
