### Checklists

Checklists are planned maintenance activities designed to ensure that machines remain in good working condition. They are carried out on a perpetual schedule. Stations are assigned and tasks are carried out as outlined in the checklist. Any deviations from expected parameters are noted in the comments table of a checklist. Checklists appear in the planned maintenance calendar.

### Work Orders

Work Orders are documents used to track breakdown maintenance. They keep records of downtime, who attended to the breakdown, and the method and spares used to resolve the issue as well as where exactly the breakdown occurred. 

### Preventative Tasks

Preventative tasks are maintenance activities undertaken either on a planned future date or a regular interval assigned by the maintenance planner. All the resources required to accomplish the task are outlined in the document in terms of manpower requirements, machine downtime and spares required. The status of the preventative task is then updated by the resolvers over a period of time. 

### Spares Requests

Spares requests are documents that are raised to track the movement of items used in regular maintenance activities.
