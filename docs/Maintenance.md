### Checklists

Checklists are planned maintenance activities designed to ensure that machines remain in good working condition. They are carried out on a perpetual schedule. Stations are assigned and tasks are carried out as outlined in the checklist. Any deviations from expected parameters are noted in the comments table of a checklist. Checklists appear in the planned maintenance calendar.

A checklist is created under the maintenance tab of the application. From there a maintenance planner enters important details regarding the checklist such as who is responsible, what category the checklist belongs to and the machine it will be performed on. The planner then outlines the checklist items that a resolver is expected to cover each time they fulfil the checklist. 

Once saved, a resolver can open a checklist and edit the comment field, where they can state the date and any remarks they have after conducting their checks on the machine. When completed they can save their comments. 

Checklists are perpetual documents that will appear in a resolver's inbox or in the planning calendar until it is put on hold or deleted.

### Work Orders

Work Orders are documents used to track breakdown maintenance. They keep records of downtime, who attended to the breakdown, and the method and spares used to resolve the issue as well as where exactly the breakdown occurred. 

A operator or artisan is responsible for raising a work order where they state the important details surrounding a breakdown, the description, when it took place and its importance. They also provide as much resolution as possible regarding where exactly the breakdown took place.  

Once saved, the breakdown will appear in the resolver's inbox. From there, they can fill in the remaining fields after attending to the breakdown, the action taken, the time taken, and the downtime that resulted from the breakdown. Any further comments can also be recorded in this form.

A completed breakdown maintenance tasks needs to be approved, the 'Update Status' dashboard allows a suitable user with elevated privileges to enter their username and password as well as the new status for the document.

### Preventative Tasks

Preventative tasks are maintenance activities undertaken either on a planned future date or a regular interval assigned by the maintenance planner. All the resources required to accomplish the task are outlined in the document in terms of manpower requirements, machine downtime and spares required. The status of the preventative task is then updated by the resolvers over a period of time. 

When first created by a maintenance planner, a preventative task is assigned a frequency, which may be once off or on a regular schedule. The user also determines how much time the task is likely to take, the spares required and also provide a brief description of the work to be undertaken. Once more the exact location on the machine to be worked on is provided as part of the form.

The preventative task is then executed by an artisan on the scheduled date. They update the form providing details regarding the feedback on the task, the actual downtime and when they actually did the job. 

### Spares Requests

Spares requests are documents that are raised to track the movement of items used in regular maintenance activities. 
A user may request spares for a work order or preventative task. In the request, the user provides the date, the name of the job, who's requesting the spares and the job the spares are being requested for. The job id is validated against those present in the system and it must map to a valid planned task or work order.
The users then interact with a table to provide the item, units and quantities required for the job.

On submission, the quantities of items are updated in the system and the document is no longer available to edit.
